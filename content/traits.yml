# All built-in traits.
# "name", "img" and "desc" are all cosmetic fields you can change as you like.
# "type" describes what weapon type the trait must be paired with to be useful. This informs the generation of randomised AI enemies (so you won't get an archer with a healer trait like Miracle).
# "effect" determines what the effect will actually do. Trait effects are hard-coded.
# The allowed effects are "guardian", "wildfire", "miracle", "birthright", "blessing" and "warpath", named after the default traits in the game.
# Further fields allow you to customise the tuning of the trait. You can create two traits with the same effect but different names, balancing, etc.
