# RPG Test
A Fire Emblem-style RPG built with Python and Pygame.

# User Guide
Run the main file to play the game - pretty simple.

You can then edit the files in the content folder to change settings and add your own custom content such as characters, weapons and maps.

Do not edit the basecontent folder. This keeps a backup of the default content so that you can freely replace files in the content folder without breaking something by mistake. If you do tamper with basecontent, you may well actually break something.
