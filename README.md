# RPG Test
A tactical RPG made with Python and Pygame, based on games like Fire Emblem.

# User Guide
Run the main file to play the game - pretty simple. See the Dependencies section for what you'll need to install first.

You can then edit the files in the content folder to change settings and add your own custom content such as characters, weapons and maps.

# Dependencies
You'll need Python 3, and the below modules. Add Python to PATH, then in command prompt type `pip install X`, once each for all of:
 - numpy
 - pygame
 - pytmx
 - pyyaml

# v2.1 Changelog
 - Added map selection, with a working scrollbar for if there are many maps in the content folder.
 - Added preview.png and data.yml to individual map folders. These files allow you to customise the previews of your custom maps on the map select screen.
 - Made menu items move when you hover over them, so that it's more clear which is being selected.
 - Made the pause menu look a little different.
 - Obligatory miscellaneous code tweaks. You don't care about these.
