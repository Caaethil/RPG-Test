# RPG Test
A Fire Emblem-style RPG built with Python and Pygame.

# User Guide
Run the main file to play the game - pretty simple. See the Dependencies section for what you'll need to install first.

You can then edit the files in the content folder to change settings and add your own custom content such as characters, weapons and maps.

Do not edit the basecontent folder. This keeps a backup of the default content so that you can freely replace files in the content folder without breaking something by mistake. If you do tamper with basecontent, you may well actually break something.

# Dependencies
You'll need Python 3, and the below modules. Add Python to PATH, then in command prompt type `pip install X`, once each for all of:
 - numpy
 - pygame
 - pytmx
 - pyyaml
