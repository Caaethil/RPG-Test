# RPG Test
A tactical RPG made with Python and Pygame, based on games like Fire Emblem. The player controls a group of units on a variety of maps, the goal being to defeat all of the enemy units. You can play singleplayer against an AI opponent, or multiplayer against a friend. The game also supports the implementation of custom units, weapons and maps without any coding knowledge required.
